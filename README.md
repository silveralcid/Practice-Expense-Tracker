## Project Information

In preparation for my upcoming studies at Western Governors University, I took the initiative to familiarize myself with key technologies in the curriculum. Recognizing the importance of ASP.NET, I embarked on a practical project using C#, ASP.NET MVC, and SQL Express to get a head start on core concepts before my classes began.
This project represents my first foray into functional development beyond basic websites and console applications. Over a focused two-week period, I set out to create a working CRUD application while getting to grips with ASP.NET fundamentals. I chose SQL Express as the database management system, which allowed me to delve into database connectivity, including setting up Entity Framework, performing migrations, and ensuring smooth data communication.

To enhance the user interface, I incorporated Syncfusion UI components, giving me hands-on experience with professional-grade tools. The project's manageable scope helped me build confidence in full-stack development, covering everything from backend C# logic and SQL database management to frontend design.

While the application is functional, I intentionally left it as a work in progress. My goal was to use it as a learning tool to reinforce my understanding of essential ASP.NET MVC patterns and practices, such as controller setup, model binding, and view rendering. This experience provided valuable insights into structuring a CRUD app and handling database operations, significantly improving my grasp of web development workflows.

Although I don't plan to expand this project further, the process was incredibly rewarding. It equipped me with a solid foundation in ASP.NET and SQL, which I'm excited to build upon as I progress through my studies and professional development journey.
